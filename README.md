# GC Signature Generator

A work in progress -- see https://jsfiddle.net/______kevin/wLqpcj92/81/show for a working example.

At present, will generate a [GC Policy compliant](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27600#appE) email signature block based on the entered details; in my (extremely limited, thanks pandemic & virtual school management :sweat_smile:) spare time I've been working on adding the capability to pre-fill fields based on a GEDS search.
